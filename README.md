# Intermediate Python3 Projects
In this repository we have some projects that I have built using concepts of object oriented Programming, modules such as the turtle in-built python module to create code.
Below we mention the various projects in this repository.
## Coffee_Machine
This project contains code which helps us to mimic the functionality of an actual coffee machine where the user is asked for their choice of drinks and checks if the machine has enough Resources or not to make the ordered drink. After the machine continues to ask the user to input their money for the drink and returns the change back to user with their drink.
