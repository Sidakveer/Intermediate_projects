# Intermediate Python3 Projects
In this repository we have some projects that I have built using concepts of object oriented Programming, modules such as the turtle in-built python module to create code.
Below we mention the various projects in this repository.
## Coffee_Machine
This project contains code which helps us to mimic the functionality of an actual coffee machine where the user is asked for their choice of drink (espresso/latte/cappuccino)) and checks if the machine has enough Resources or not to make the ordered drink. If resources are enough the machine then continues to ask the user to input their money for the drink and returns the change back to user with their drink. The machine can also be turned off at any point if nedded by using "off" as input as well as display a list of resources available in the machine at any given time by entering "report" as input.
## Quiz_Game
In this project we a typical True/False Quiz game that anyone can play. The question data set is a list of Question objects created using the question class each containg the question and their respective answers. The QuizBrain class is then used to generate the questions that are displayed on the screen of the current player and the player is asked to enter their answer (true or false). Based on the input the program checks whether the input matches the answer or not and adds one to the score of the player is the anwser is correct. And so on the game continues till all questions are asked finally returning the players final score.
